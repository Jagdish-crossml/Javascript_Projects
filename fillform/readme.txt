-- action.js is making api call to locally hosted(on jsonserver)  fetch.json file fields and returning response.
-- Target form is being hosted on a local server and json data will fill two fields of the form 1.fname,2.lname.
-- popup.js take username and when submitted then action.js script executes.
-- TODO --
= script should be executed when the username from json file finds a match.
= there should be the use of XPATH of the target form to map the json field values to respective fields of the form.
= Hw to use background.js in this project??
